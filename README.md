Admittedly leaned a lot on ai to help me make this one. Microsoft's copilot.
WinAPI is NOT well documented 
(as most things aren't, or not in a searchable way, and if how to do x specific thing cannot be searched, documentation isn't useful anywway).
also used a lot of BOOL where I could've used bool because I didn't know the latter is more efficient.
